# whoburnedmore

> Find out who burned more — submit your AI coding-agent token usage to the public
> leaderboard at [whoburnedmore.com](https://whoburnedmore.com).

```bash
npx whoburnedmore
```

**This is the real, production CLI** — the exact code published to npm and run on users'
machines. This repository is a public, always-in-sync mirror of it.

## What it does

`whoburnedmore` reads your local AI coding-agent usage (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
Copilot, Cursor and more, via [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)), adds up
the tokens and estimated cost, and **submits your daily totals to the whoburnedmore.com
server** so you land on the public leaderboard and get a shareable dashboard.

Your **first run signs you in** — the CLI opens a page and you approve a short code — then
binds this machine to your account so your usage lands on the leaderboard under your handle.
(Prefer to stay fully offline? `--local` never signs in and never uploads.)

### What leaves your machine

Only **daily aggregate numbers** — date, tool, model, token counts, and estimated cost
(plus optional per-session / per-tool rollups). **Never** your prompts, your code, file
contents, or file paths. Run `private` to drop off the board, `remove` to delete your
dashboard and its data, or use `--local` to stay fully offline.

> Want a 100%-local report that makes **no** network calls at all? Use `npx whoburnedmore
> --local`, which builds an HTML dashboard on your machine and uploads nothing.

## Commands

```
npx whoburnedmore                sign in, submit, land on the leaderboard, open your dashboard
npx whoburnedmore --board=CODE   compare with friends — sign in and join their board
npx whoburnedmore --org=SLUG     submit to your organization's board (companies/hackathons)
npx whoburnedmore --local        build the dashboard locally and open it (offline, no upload)
npx whoburnedmore --dry-run      print exactly what would be sent, send nothing
npx whoburnedmore --no-submit    collect locally, send nothing
npx whoburnedmore link --token=TOKEN  bind a server/VM to your account (token from your profile)
npx whoburnedmore daemon         keep syncing in the foreground (containers with no scheduler)
npx whoburnedmore private        hide your dashboard from the leaderboard
npx whoburnedmore public         put it back
npx whoburnedmore remove         delete your dashboard and its data
npx whoburnedmore verify         delisted? re-verify your usage to get back on
npx whoburnedmore status         check background-sync health (last sync, staleness)
npx whoburnedmore install-sync     turn on 15-minute background sync
npx whoburnedmore uninstall-sync   turn off the background sync
```

After your first run, a background sync keeps your page fresh automatically
every 15 minutes (`uninstall-sync` to stop). The installed background job runs
the latest published `whoburnedmore` package on each sync tick, so future CLI
fixes are picked up automatically after the next refresh. The server endpoint is
overridable with `WHOBURNEDMORE_API`.

## Privacy & transparency

This repository exists so you can read exactly what the CLI does before you run it. It
contains no secrets and no server code — just the client that talks to the public API.
